abstract = {This paper looks at the early theory of phase transitions. It considers a group of related concepts derived from condensed matter and statistical physics. The key technical ideas here go under the names of "singularity", "order parameter", "mean field theory", and "variational method". In a less technical vein, the question here is how can matter, ordinary matter, support a diversity of forms. We see this diversity each time we observe ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor, "steam", come up from a pot of heated water. Different phases can be qualitatively different in that walking on ice is well within human capacity, but walking on liquid water is proverbially forbidden to ordinary humans. These differences have been apparent to humankind for millennia, but only brought within the domain of scientific understanding since the 1880s. A phase transition is a change from one behavior to another. A first order phase transition involves a discontinuous jump in a some statistical variable of the system. The discontinuous property is called the order parameter. Each phase transitions has its own order parameter that range over a tremendous variety of physical properties. These properties include the density of a liquid gas transition, the magnetization in a ferromagnet, the size of a connected cluster in a percolation transition, and a condensate wave function in a superfluid or superconductor. A continuous transition occurs when that jump approaches zero. This note is about statistical mechanics and the development of mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of this phenomenon.},

abstract = {Some critical trends in information theory, its role in living systems and utilization in fluctuation theory are discussed. The mutual information of thermodynamic coupling is incorporated into the generalized fluctuation theorem by using information theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Thermodynamically coupled dissipative structures in living systems are capable of degrading more energy, and processing 
complex information through developmental and environmental constraints. The generalized fluctuation theorem can quantify the hysteresis observed in the amount of the irreversible work in nonequilibrium regimes in the presence of information and 
thermodynamic coupling.

abstract = {Spin-echo experiments are often said to constitute an instant of antithermodynamic behavior in a concrete physical system that violates the second law of thermodynamics. We argue that a proper thermodynamic treatment of the effect should take into account the correlations between the spin and the translational degrees of freedom of the molecules. To this end, we construct an entropy functional using Boltzmann macrostates that incorporate both spin and translational degrees of freedom. With this definition there is nothing special in the thermodynamics of spin echoes: dephasing corresponds to Hamiltonian evolution and leaves the entropy unchanged; dissipation increases the entropy. In particular, there is no phase of entropy decrease in the echo. We also discuss the definition of macrostates from the underlying quantum theory and we show that the decay of net magnetization provides a faithful measure of entropy change.},

abstract = {There are a great number of thermodynamic schools, independent of each other, and without a powerful general approach, but with a split on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In 1912, in relation to the stationary non-equilibrium states, Ehrenfest introduced the fundamental question on the existence of a functional that achieves its extreme value for stable states, as entropy does for the stationary states in equilibrium thermodynamics. Today, the new branch frontiers of science and engineering, from power engineering to environmental sciences, from chaos to complex systems, from life sciences to nanosciences, etc. require a unified approach in order to optimize results and obtain a powerful approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics and open systems. In this paper, a generalization of the Gouy{\textendash}Stodola approach is suggested as a possible answer to the Ehrenfest question.},

abstract = {A thermostatted dynamical model with five degrees of freedom is used to test both the Evans-Searles and the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relations (ESFR and GCFR respectively). In the absence of an external driving field, the model generates a time independent ergodic equilibrium state with two conjugate pairs of Lyapunov exponents. Each conjugate pair sums to zero. The fluctuation relations are tested numerically both near and far from equilibrium. As expected from previous work, near equilibrium the ESFR is verified by the simulation data while the GCFR is not confirmed by the data. Far from equilibrium where a positive exponent in one of these conjugate pairs becomes negative, we test a conjecture regarding the GCFR made by Gallavotti and co-workers. They conjectured that where the number of nontrivial Lyapunov exponents that are positive becomes less than the number of such negative exponents, then the form of the GCFR needs to be corrected. We show that there is no evidence for this conjecture in the empirical data. In fact as the field increases, the uncorrected form of the GCFR appears to become more accurate. The real reason for this observation is likely to be that as the field increases, the argument of the GCFR more and more accurately approximates the argument of the ESFR. Since the ESFR works for arbitrary field strengths, the uncorrected GCFR appears to become ever more accurate as the field increases. The final point of evidence against the conjecture is that when the smallest positive exponent changes sign, the conjecture predicts a discontinuous change in the "correction factor" for GCFR. We see no evidence for a discontinuity at this field strength; only a gradual improvement of degree of agreement as the field increases.

With the help of simple electrical network models, at least six interesting and most used principles are distinguished: the least dissipation, the near-equilibrium (linear) minimum entropy production (MinEP), the near-equilibrium (linear) maximum entropy production (MaxEP), the far-from-equilibrium (non-linear) non-variational MaxEP, the far-from equilibrium variational MaxEP and the optimization MinEP. With this framework, the different assumptions, regions of validity, constraints and applications are explained, as well as their theoretical proofs, counterexamples or experimental verifications. The examples will be kept as simple as possible, in order to focus more on the concepts instead of the technicalities. By better defining the settings of the principles, this classification sheds some new light on some principles, and new ideas for future research are presented, especially for the more recent far-from-equilibrium principles.},

abstract = {By taking full advantage of the dynamic property imposed by the detailed balance condition, we derive a new refined unified fluctuation theorem (FT) for general stochastic thermodynamic systems. This FT involves the joint probability distribution functions of the final phase-space point and a thermodynamic variable. Jarzynski equality, Crooks fluctuation theorem, and the FTs of heat as well as the trajectory entropy production can be regarded as special cases of this refined unified FT, and all of them are generalized to arbitrary initial distributions. We also find that the refined unified FT can easily reproduce the FTs for processes with the feedback control, due to its unconventional structure that separates the thermodynamic variable from the choices of initial distributions. Our result is heuristic for further understanding of the relations and distinctions between all kinds of FTs and might be valuable for studying thermodynamic processes with information exchange.},

abstract = {Equilibrium free energy differences are given by exponential averages of nonequilibrium work values; such averages, however, often converge poorly, as they are dominated by rare realizations. I show that there is a simple and intuitively appealing description of these rare but dominant realizations. This description is expressed as a duality between ``forward'' and ``reverse'' processes, and provides both heuristic insights and quantitative estimates regarding the number of realizations needed for convergence of the exponential average. Analogous results apply to the equilibrium perturbation method of estimating free energy differences. The pedagogical example of a piston and gas [R.C. Lua and A.Y. Grosberg, J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 6805 (2005)] is used to illustrate the general discussion.},

abstract = {We consider thermal conduction in a classical many body system which is in contact with two isothermal reservoirs maintained at different temperatures. We calculate from first principles, the probability that when observed for a finite time, the time averaged heat flux flows in the reverse direction to that required by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Analytical expressions are given for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical fluctuations in this system. These expressions constitute an application of the Fluctuation Theorem to the problem of thermal conduction. We prove that the probability of observing fluctuations in the heat flux which violate the Second Law is related to time averaged fluctuations in the irreversible entropy production. Our expressions are tested using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of heat flow between thermostatted walls.},

The key idea that we try to clarify is that of {\textquotedblleft}dynamical ensembles{\textquotedblright}, as a generalization of the classical {\textquotedblleft}equilibrium ensembles{\textquotedblright}, arguing that they should be identified with the SRB distributions and that they share several properties with the classical ensembles. Most of the results invoked here did not deal directly with the Navier-Stokes equations and yet they seem to have a lot to do with them (as we shall argue): here the discussion will focus on the Navier-Stokes and dissipative Euler equations with the aim of proposing several experiments apt to test the equivalence of dynamical ensembles and the chaotic hypothesis. The ideas developed, to a great extent, from the efforts put in interpreting the experimental results in (Bonetto et al., 1996).},

abstract = {In this paper a theoretical investigation is made of various properties of the steady-state inhomogeneous turbulent convection of heat in a fluid between horizontal conducting surfaces. An upper limit to the heat transport is found subject to the constraint that some minimum eddy size exists which is effective in this transport. The spectrum of convecting motions, the mean thermal gradients at each point and the eddy conductivity are then determined in terms of the minimum eddy size. The relation between the boundary conditions and eddy size is studied by an extension of the work of Pellew {\&} Southwell using the mean thermal gradients deduced when n$\_{0}$ modes of motion are present to establish the Rayleigh number at which the (n$\_{0}$ + 1)th mode first becomes unstable. In a final section the spectra and mean-square values of the fluctuating velocity and temperature fields are estimated from the Boussinesq form of the hydrodynamic equations. The previously reported experimental heat transports are within 10% of those predicted. The discrete transitions are within the error limits of the observations. However, further data must be gathered to justify the use of minimum eddy size as a defining parameter in situations of geophysical scale.},

abstract = {Using the recently derived Dissipation Theorem and a corollary of the Transient Fluctuation Theorem (TFT), namely the Second Law Inequality, we derive the unique time independent, equilibrium phase space distribution function for an ergodic Hamiltonian system in contact with a remote heat bath. We prove under very general conditions that any deviation from this equilibrium distribution breaks the time independence of the distribution. Provided temporal correlations decay, and the system is ergodic, we show that any nonequilibrium distribution that is an even function of the momenta, eventually relaxes (not necessarily monotonically) to the equilibrium distribution. Finally we prove that the negative logarithm of the microscopic partition function is equal to the thermodynamic Helmholtz free energy divided by the thermodynamic temperature and Boltzmann's constant. Our results complement and extend the findings of modern ergodic theory and show the importance of dissipation in the process of relaxation towards equilibrium.

The analysis provides a theoretical justification of a local, conditional form of the maximum entropy production principle, which successfully predicts the observable properties of many such systems. The analysis reveals a very different manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics in steady-state flow systems, which provides a driving force for the formation of complex systems, including life.},

abstract = {A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector ${q}_{0}$ and frequency ${\ensuremath{\omega}}_{0}$ of the instability. Type ${\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{s}}$ systems (${\ensuremath{\omega}}_{0}=0$, ${q}_{0}\ensuremath{\ne}0$) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type ${\mathrm{III}}_{\mathrm{o}}$ systems (${\ensuremath{\omega}}_{0}\ensuremath{\ne}0$, ${q}_{0}=0$) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type ${\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{o}}$ systems (${\ensuremath{\omega}}_{0}\ensuremath{\ne}0$, ${q}_{0}\ensuremath{\ne}0$) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via "amplitude equations," whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the "phase equation" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing "real pattern effects" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying "temporal chaos," where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics. A concluding section summarizes what has and has not been accomplished, and attempts to assess the prospects for the future.},

We model the system by a suitable Markov jump process, and treat thermodynamic operations as protocols according to which the external agent varies parameters of the Markov process. Then we prove, among other relations, a NESS version of the Jarzynski equality and the extended Clausius relation. The latter can be a starting point of thermodynamics for NESS. We also find that the corresponding nonequilibrium entropy has a microscopic representation in terms of symmetrized Shannon entropy in systems where the microscopic description of states involves "momenta". All the results in the present paper are mathematically rigorous.},

They were originally introduced by McLennan for mechanical systems close to equilibrium and more recent work by Komatsu and Nakagawa has shown their intimate relation to the transient fluctuation symmetry. Here we derive these distributions for jump and diffusion Markov processes and we clarify the order of the limits that take the system both to its stationary regime and to the close-to-equilibrium regime. In particular, we prove that it is exactly the (finite) transient component of the irreversible part of the entropy flux that corrects the Boltzmann distribution to first order in the driving. We add further connections with the notion of local equilibrium, with the Green-Kubo relation and with a generalized expression for the stationary distribution in terms of a reference equilibrium process.},

Here, we explicitly propose a first step toward such a relationship in the form of a causal generalization of entropic forces that we find can cause two defining behaviors of the human ``cognitive niche''\char22{}tool use and social cooperation\char22{}to spontaneously emerge in simple physical systems. Our results suggest a potentially general thermodynamic model of adaptive behavior as a nonequilibrium process in open systems.},

abstract = {Reciprocal relations correlate fairly accurately a great variety of experimental results. Nevertheless, the concepts of statistical fluctuations, and microscopic reversibility - the bases of the accepted proof of the relations by Onsager - are illusory and faulty, and contradict the foundations of the science of thermodynamics. The definitions, postulates, and main theorems of thermodynamics are briefly presented. It is shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that thermodynamics is a nonstatistical science that applies to all systems (both macroscopic, and microscopic, including systems that consist either of only one structureless particle, or only one spin), to all states (both thermodynamic or stable equilibrium, and not stable equilibrium), and that includes entropy as a well defined, intrinsic, nonstatistical property of any system in any state, at any instant in time. In the light of this novel conception of thermodynamics, we find that reciprocal relations result from a well known mathematical theorem, to wit, given a well behaved analytic function of many variables then the second derivative of the function with respect to any two variables is independent of the order of differentiation, namely, whether the first derivative is taken with respect to the one or the other of the two variables.},

abstract = {A general reciprocal relation, applicable to transport processes such as the conduction of heat and electricity, and diffusion, is derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility. In the derivation, certain average products of fluctuations are considered. As a consequence of the general relation $S=k logW$ between entropy and probability, different (coupled) irreversible processes must be compared in terms of entropy changes. If the displacement from thermodynamic equilibrium is described by a set of variables ${\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{1},\ensuremath{\cdots},{\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{n}$, and the relations between the rates ${\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}_{1},\ensuremath{\cdots},{\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}_{n}$ and the "forces" $\frac{\ensuremath{\partial}S}{d{\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{1}},\ensuremath{\cdots},\frac{\ensuremath{\partial}S}{d{\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{n}}$ are linear, there exists a quadratic dissipation-function, $2\ensuremath{\Phi}(\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}},\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}})\ensuremath{\equiv}\ensuremath{\Sigma}{\ensuremath{\rho}}_{j}{\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}_{\mathrm{ij}}{\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}_{i}=\frac{\mathrm{dS}}{\mathrm{dt}}=\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{S}(\ensuremath{\alpha},\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}})\ensuremath{\equiv}\ensuremath{\Sigma}(\frac{\ensuremath{\partial}S}{d{\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{j}}){\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}_{j}$ (denoting definition by $\ensuremath{\equiv}$). The symmetry conditions demanded by microscopic reversibility are equivalent to the variation-principle $\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{S}(\ensuremath{\alpha},\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}})\ensuremath{-}\ensuremath{\Phi}(\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}},\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}})=\mathrm{maximum},$ which determines ${\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}_{1},\ensuremath{\cdots},{\stackrel{\ifmmode \dot{}\else \.{}\fi{}}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}_{n}$ for prescribed ${\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{1},\ensuremath{\cdots},{\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{n}$. The dissipation-function has a statistical significance similar to that of the entropy. External magnetic fields, and also Coriolis forces, destroy the symmetry in past and future; reciprocal relations involving reversal of the field are formulated.},

abstract = {The concept of entropy and its relevant principles, mainly the principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), the effect of negative entropy flow (NEF) on the organization of atmospheric systems and the principle of the Second Law of thermodynamics, as well as their applications to atmospheric sciences, are reviewed. 
Some formulations of sub-grid processes such as diffusion parameterization schemes in computational geophysical fluid dynamics that can be improved based on 
full-irreversibility are also discussed, although they have not yet been systematically subjected to scrutiny from the perspective of the entropy budgets. A comparative investigation shows that the principle of MEP applies to the entropy production of macroscopic fluxes and determines the most probable state, that is, a system may choose a development meta-stable trajectory with a smaller production since entropy production behavior involves many specific dynamical and thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere and the extremal principles only provide a general insight into the overall configuration of the atmosphere. In contrast to the principle of MEP, the analysis of NEF is able to provide a new insight into the mechanism responsible for the evolution of a weather system as well as a new approach to predicting its track and intensity trend.

abstract = {For classical systems driven out of equilibrium, Crooks derived a relation (the Crooks-Jarzynski relation), whose special cases include a relation (the Crooks relation) equivalent to the Kawasaki non-linear response relation. We derive a quantum extension of the Crooks-Jarzynski relation without explicitly using the principle of microreversibility. Its special cases lead to the Jarzynski equality and the standard linear response theory with a Green-Kubo formula with a canonical correlation function. We also derive a quantum extension of the Crooks relation using the principle of microreversibility. Its special cases lead to the Jarzynski equality, the Crooks transient fluctuation theorem, and the fluctuation theorem for current or shear stress, which leads to a Green-Kubo formula with a symmetrized correlation function. For each quantum Crooks relation, there exists a corresponding quantum Crooks-Jarzynski relation. Using either relation, we can derive the Jarzynski equality, the fluctuation theorems mentioned above, and the standard linear response theory.},

abstract = {Using the method of computer simulation we test the predictions of nonlinear response theory for classical systems subject to dissipative external fields. We provide convincing numerical evidence that Kawasaki methods agree with both the transient time correlation function predictions and with a direct measurement of the nonlinear response. Furthermore, this numerical agreement is observed over a time scale which is sufficiently long for the response to have relaxed to within \ensuremath{\sim}1% of its nonequilibrium steady-state value. This is in spite of the fact that in the steady state the N-particle distribution function ultimately becomes fractal. We discuss the normalization of the Kawasaki distribution and derive a ``Lagrangian form'' of the Kawasaki response function, and show that it is consistent with predictions that are obtained using a natural invariant measure for nonequilibrium steady states.

These global cycles result in the maintenance of a unique thermodynamic state of the Earth's atmosphere which is far from thermodynamic equilibrium (TE). Here, I provide a simple introduction of the thermodynamic basis to understand why Earth system processes operate so far away from TE. I use a simple toy model to illustrate the application of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and to classify applications of the proposed principle of maximum entropy production (MEP) to such processes into three different cases of contrasting flexibility in the boundary conditions. I then provide a brief overview of the different processes within the Earth system that produce entropy, review actual examples of MEP in environmental and ecological systems, and discuss the role of interactions among dissipative processes in making boundary conditions more flexible. I close with a brief summary and conclusion.},

However, the entropy production, crucial to the second law, has also other features not clearly conceived. We all know that the main difficulty is concerned with its quantification in non-equilibrium processes and consequently its value for some specific cases is limited. In this work we will review the ideas behind the entropy production concept and we will give some insights about its relevance. },

abstract = {Fluctuation theorems, which have been developed over the past 15 years, have resulted in fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of how irreversibility emerges from reversible dynamics, and have provided new statistical mechanical relationships for free energy changes. They describe the statistical fluctuations in time-averaged properties of many-particle systems such as fluids driven to nonequilibrium states, and provide some of the very few analytical expressions that describe nonequilibrium states. Quantitative predictions on fluctuations in small systems that are monitored over short periods can also be made, and therefore the fluctuation theorems allow thermodynamic concepts to be extended to apply to finite systems. For this reason, fluctuation theorems are anticipated to play an important role in the design of nanotechnological devices and in understanding biological processes. These theorems, their physical significance and results for experimental and model systems are discussed.

It did cause a revision of our views of motion, particularly through Boltzmann and Poincar\'e: we discuss how Boltmann's conception of motion is still very modern and how it can provide ideas and methods to study the problem of nonequilibrium in mechanics and in fluids. This leads to the chaotic hypothesis, a recent interpretation of a very ambitious principle conceived by D. Ruelle: it is a possible extension of the ergodic hypothesis and it implies general parameterless relations. Together with further ideas, it appears to be consistent with some recent experiments as we discuss here.},

abstract = {General aspects of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation (FDR), and Response Theory are considered. After analyzing the conceptual and historical relevance of fluctuations in statistical mechanics, we illustrate the relation between the relaxation of spontaneous fluctuations, and the response to an external perturbation. These studies date back to Einstein's work on Brownian Motion, were continued by Nyquist and Onsager and culminated in Kubo's linear response theory. The FDR has been originally developed in the framework of statistical mechanics of Hamiltonian systems, nevertheless a generalized FDR holds under rather general hypotheses, regardless of the Hamiltonian, or equilibrium nature of the system. In the last decade, this subject was revived by the works on Fluctuation Relations (FR) concerning far from equilibrium systems. The connection of these works with large deviation theory is analyzed. Some examples, beyond the standard applications of statistical mechanics, where fluctuations play a major role are discussed: fluids, granular media, nano-systems and biological systems.

abstract = {Persistent misconceptions existing for dozens of years and influencing progress in various fields of science are sometimes encountered in the scientific and especially, the popular-science literature. The present brief review deals with two such interrelated misconceptions (misunderstandings). The first misunderstanding: entropy is a measure of disorder. This is an old and very common opinion. The second misconception is that the entropy production minimizes in the evolution of nonequilibrium systems. However, as it has recently become clear, evolution (progress) in Nature demonstrates the opposite, i.e., maximization of the entropy production. The principal questions connected with this maximization are considered herein. The two misconceptions mentioned above can lead to the apparent contradiction between the conclusions of modern thermodynamics and the basic conceptions of evolution existing in biology. In this regard, the analysis of these issues seems extremely important and timely as it contributes to the deeper understanding of the laws of development of the surrounding World and the place of humans in it.},

abstract = {We observe entropy decrease towards the past. Does this imply that in the past the world was in a non-generic microstate? I point out an alternative. The subsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small number of quantities, which define a coarse graining. Entropy happens to depends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe depends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low past entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate of the universe) is non-generic. I argue that for any generic microstate of a sufficiently rich system there are always special subsystems defining a coarse graining for which the entropy of the rest is low in one time direction (the "past"). These are the subsystems allowing creatures that "live in time" ---such as those in the biosphere--- to exist. I reply to some objections raised to an earlier presentation of this idea, in particular by Bob Wald, David Albert and Jim Hartle.},

Examples of Gaussian mixtures include random variables with densities proportional to e-|t|p and symmetric p-stable random variables, where p(0,2]. We obtain various sharp moment and entropy comparison estimates for weighted sums of independent Gaussian mixtures and investigate extensions of the B-inequality and the Gaussian correlation inequality in the context of Gaussian mixtures. We also obtain a correlation inequality for symmetric geodesically convex sets in the unit sphere equipped with the normalized surface area measure. We then apply these results to derive sharp constants in Khintchine inequalities for vectors uniformly distributed on the unit balls with respect to p-norms and provide short proofs to new and old comparison estimates for geometric parameters of sections and projections of such balls.},

Maxwell's demon can lower the entropy of his surroundings by an amount equal to the difference between the maximum entropy of his recording device and its initial entropy, without generating a compensating entropy increase. A demon with human-scale recording devices can reduce the entropy of a gas by a negligible amount only, but the proof of the demon's impracticability leaves open the possibility that systems highly correlated with their environment can reduce the environment's entropy by a substantial amount without increasing entropy elsewhere. In the event that a boundary condition for the universe requires it to be in a state of low entropy when small, the correlations induced between different particle modes during the expansion phase allow the modes to behave like Maxwell's demons during the contracting phase, reducing the entropy of the universe to a low value.},

Our results are not restricted to a particular model and show that the steady state fluctuation relation for the dissipation function holds near or far from equilibrium subject to these conditions. The dissipation function thus plays a comparable role in nonequilibrium systems to thermodynamic potentials in equilibrium systems.},

abstract = {Is Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) a physical principle? In this paper I tentatively suggest it is not, on the basis that MEP is equivalent to Jaynes{\textquoteright} Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) inference algorithm that passively translates physical assumptions into macroscopic predictions, as applied to non-equilibrium systems. MaxEnt itself has no physical content; disagreement between MaxEnt predictions and experiment falsifies the physical assumptions, not MaxEnt. While it remains to be shown rigorously that MEP is indeed equivalent to MaxEnt for systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium, work in progress tentatively supports this conclusion. In terms of its role within non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, MEP might then be better understood as Messenger of Essential Physics.},

abstract = {Using the Dissipation Theorem and a corollary of the Fluctuation Theorem, namely the Second Law Inequality, we give a first-principles derivation of Boltzmann's postulate of equal a priori probability in phase space for the microcanonical ensemble. We show that if the initial distribution differs from the uniform distribution over the energy hypersurface, then under very wide and commonly satisfied conditions, the initial distribution will relax to that uniform distribution. This result is somewhat analogous to the Boltzmann H-theorem but unlike that theorem, applies to dense fluids as well as dilute gases and also permits a nonmonotonic relaxation to equilibrium. We also prove that in ergodic systems the uniform (microcanonical) distribution is the only stationary, dissipationless distribution for the constant energy ensemble.

abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

abstract = {The description of nonequilibrium processes in nano-sized objects, where the typical energies involved are a few times, is increasingly becoming central to disciplines as diverse as condensed-matter physics, materials science, and biophysics. Major recent developments towards a unified treatment of arbitrarily large fluctuations in small systems are described by fluctuation theorems that relate the probabilities of a system absorbing from or releasing to the bath a given amount of energy in a nonequilibrium process. Here we experimentally verify the Crooks Fluctuation Theorem (CFT) under weak and strong nonequilibrium conditions by using optical tweezers to measure the irreversible mechanical work during the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. We also show that the CFT provides a powerful way to obtain folding free energies in biomolecules by determining the crossing between the unfolding and refolding irreversible work distributions. The method makes it possible to obtain folding free energies in nonequilibrium processes that dissipate up to of the average total work exerted, thereby paving the way for reconstructing free energy landscapes along reaction coordinates in nonequilibrium single-molecule experiments.

In particular: (1) we show that Ziegler's principle of thermodynamic orthogonality leads to stringent reciprocal relations for higher order response coefficients, and in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, we exhibit a simple explicit model that does not satisfy them; (2) on a network, enforcing Kirchhoff's current law, we show that maximization of the entropy production prescribes reciprocal relations between coarse-grained observables, but is not responsible for the onset of the steady state, which is, rather, due to the minimum entropy production principle.},

abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics like work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power, can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones like molecular motors, and heat engines like thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.

abstract = {Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic field ${H}_{0}$. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in ${H}_{0}$. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

abstract = {The maximum entropy principle (MEP) is a method for obtaining the most likely distribution functions of observables from statistical systems, by maximizing entropy under constraints. The MEP has found hundreds of applications in ergodic and Markovian systems in statistical mechanics, information theory, and statistics. For several decades there exists an ongoing controversy whether the notion of the maximum entropy principle can be extended in a meaningful way to non-extensive, non-ergodic, and complex statistical systems and processes. In this paper we start by reviewing how Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy is related to multiplicities of independent random processes. We then show how the relaxation of independence naturally leads to the most general entropies that are compatible with the first three Shannon-Khinchin axioms, the (c,d)-entropies. We demonstrate that the MEP is a perfectly consistent concept for non-ergodic and complex statistical systems if their relative entropy can be factored into a generalized multiplicity and a constraint term. The problem of finding such a factorization reduces to finding an appropriate representation of relative entropy in a linear basis. In a particular example we show that path-dependent random processes with memory naturally require specific generalized entropies. The example is the first exact derivation of a generalized entropy from the microscopic properties of a path-dependent random process.},

abstract = {In recent papers, several authors have claimed that a definition of the thermodynamic entropy in terms of the logarithm of a volume in phase space, originally suggested by Gibbs, is the only valid definition. Arguing from the Gibbs entropy, these authors claim that thermodynamics cannot be extended to include negative temperatures. However, the Gibbs entropy fails to satisfy the postulates of thermodynamics, leading to serious errors. In particular, predictions of the Gibbs entropy for systems with non-monotonic energy densities are incorrect. We show that the correct expression for the equilibrium entropy contains an integral over a surface in phase space, and negative temperature is a valid thermodynamic concept.

His proof was based on Boltzmann's formula S= klnW and the dynamical invariance of the phase volume W for isolated systems (Liouville's theorem). Here Jaynes' proof is extended to show that Liouville's theorem also implies maximum entropy ...
